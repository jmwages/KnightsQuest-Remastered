# Knight's Quest - Remastered
 by *Jean-Marc Wages*

An updated version of a previous class project, rewrote code from scratch to improve it.

Run `main()` method in `KQApp` class to launch the game.

Code can be run using the normal rendering built into processing or using P2D.

P2D gives better performance but can sometimes give issues on certain computers.
To switch between modes switch the line that is commented out in the `KQApp` class.
Also switch which set of constants is commented out in the `Constants` class.

The game functions nearly identical in both versions but should be smoother in P2D
